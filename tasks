low priority
-----------------
*  lookup CLICK_SIZE_PACKED_ATTRIBUTE and see whether it makes sense for class VID

*  what do the constants under CpVaParseCmd mean? 

*  fix compilation errors with --enable-ip6

*  what does CONTEXT mean in confparse?

*  need logging  --  use GridLogger?

*  REFACTOR: create one superclass for all table related stuff like update, lookup, expire

*  set error annotation in all error pkts so that routepacket can send it out thru the error interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  find optimal values for all elements that run periodically

*  add random delays to hello advertisement -- useful esp in wireless

*  all table reads and writes should be synchronized/made atomic

*  expire entries in host table -- have the access switch communicate to the old host switch that host/hosts has/have moved?

*  hash function for host vid generation needs to change. check after generation if unique by looking up host table.

*  modify lookup function in routetable to return closest XOR distance if there are multiple choices for the same bucket (similarly for rendezvous table)
 
*  publish rdv info not only about neighbors but also abt other interfaces that are part of the same switch?

*  format output of read handlers 

*  publish host info to access switch as soon as host sends gratuitous ARP
