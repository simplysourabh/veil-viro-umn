[Key = Neighbor MAC address in neighbortable]
I changed the structure for hte neighbortable.hh a bit, so I will have to accordingly change,
the logic in other dependent elements.
The basic change is that key is the mac address of the neighbor in the table now.

[We are using a flag "usestatic" in interface table. We should get rid of this, and 
use a better input arugment list management for interfacetable.cc]

[In generatehello input is interface table, and the output connects to each physical interface]

[VCC will also need to run VEILHelloGenerator, neighrbortable, hello processor etc.]

[we assume that there will not be more than one MAC interface on veil_router which connects to same "foreign MAC" addresses.]

[we have reserved the vid/mac 00:00:00:00:00:00 for some special purpose.]
